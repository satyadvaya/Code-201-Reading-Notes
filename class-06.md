## _Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming_
- Understanding the problem is the most critical element of the equation.
- Solving problems is made much more difficult when relevant questions aren't adequately comprehended.
- The problem domain can made more manageable by narrowing one's focus to a particular part of the problem and fully understanding it before expanding further.

## Chapter3: _Object Literals_
- If a _variable_ is part of an object, it is called a **property**.
- If a _function_ is part of an object, it is called a **method**.  Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.
- Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name and a value.  In an object, that name is called a **key**.
An object cannot have two keys with the same name.  This is because keys are used to access their corresponding values.
- The value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or another object.  The value of a method is always a function.
- To access properties or methods of an object you employ **dot notation** where you name the object, enter a period (known as the member operator), and then name the property or method you want to access.
Access to the properties of an object, but not its methods, can be done using square bracket syntax where the object name is followed by square brackets and the property name is cited inside them.

## Chapter5: _Document Object Model_
- The DOM instructs browsers as to how they should model an HTML page, as well as how JavaScript can access and update content withing the brower window.
- DOM trees consist of Document, Element, Attribute, and Text nodes.
- You can select element nodes by their ID or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
- DOM queries which return more than one node in their results always produce a **NodeList**.
- An element node's content can be accessed and updated through properties such as **textContent** and **innerHTML** or by employing DOM manipulation techniques.
- An element node can contain multiple text nodes as well as child elements which are siblings of one other.
