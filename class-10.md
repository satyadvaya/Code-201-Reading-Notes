## Chapter10: _Error Handling & Debugging_
- **Order of exectution** is the order in which statements are processed.
- The JavaScript interpreter processes one line of code at a time, and stacks new functions on top of the current task when a statement requires data from another function in order to proceed.
- Comprehending the two stages of execution contexts, will improve the detection of coding errors.
    - **Prepare**
        - New scope is created;
        - Variables, functions, and arguments are created;
        - Value of the `this` keyword is determined.
    - **Execute**
        - Values assigned to variables;
        - Functions are referenced and their code run;
        - Statements are executed.
- JavaScript statements throw and **exception** when they generate an error.
- JavaScript has **7 different error types**, each creating its own error object, and revealing a line number for, and desription of, each error.
    - **`Error`**
        - Generic error - the other erros are all based upon this error
    - **`SyntaxError`**
        - Syntax has not been followed
    - **`ReferenceError`**
        - Tried to reference a variable that is not declared or within scope
    - **`TypeError`**
        - An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced
    - **`RangeError`**
        - Numbers not in acceptable range
    - **`URIError`**
        - `encodeURI()`, `decodeURI()`, and similar methods used incorrectly
    - **`EvalError`**
        - `eval()` function used incorrectly
- Debugging utilizes the process of decuction.
- Utilizing the console helps to target the area in which an error is located.
- Employing `try`, `catch`, and `release` statements can provide users helpful feedback.
