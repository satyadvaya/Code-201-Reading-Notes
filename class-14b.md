## _What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team_
- Its important to not worry that teammates are standing in judgment of members based on the ideas they propose to the group.
- _"Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of."_
- Research is commonly finding that collaborative activities at work have increased by more than 50% and that more than 75% of each day is spent in communication with colleagues.
- Recent studies have shown that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, and identify better solutions to problems.  Team participants also tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.
- _"Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team."_
- A group of psychologists in 2008 found that, _"...teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright."_
- On "good" teams, members speak in roughly equal proportions, which reflects the concept of "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking."  These teams were also socially sensitive and could read and effectively react to unspoken expression and nonverbal cues indicating when members felt upset or disenfranchised.
- Psychological safety is understood to refer to a _"shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking,"_ is _"a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,"_ and _"describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves."_
- Other team behaviors are also important, like sharing clear goals and fosering a culture of dependability, but psychological safety appears to be the critical element to team coherence and productivity.
- _"...psychological safety and emotional conversations [are] related. The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more."_
- We can't simply focus on efficiency.  We need to know that work amounts to something far greater than simple application of labor.
- Successful teams encourage emotional conversations and dicsussions of norms, despite the resistance that might naturally be encountered by some team members to engage in that fashion.
- Google's Project Aristotle research has concluded that, _"In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs."_
