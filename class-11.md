## Chapter16: _Images_
- Specify image dimensions in CSS when identically-sized images are used on multiple pages of the same website.
- CSS can align images both horizontally and vertically with the `float:` property.
- Images are inline elements by default, flowing within the text which surrounds them, and are centered on the page with the `block:` property.
- Background images can be placed behind the box created by page elements, and will be repeated across the background of the entire box by default.
    - The `background-repeat:` property can have a value of `repeat`, `repeat-x`, `repeat-y`, or `no-repeat`.
    - The `background-attachment:` property can have a value of either `fixed` or `scroll`.
- Manipulating the background position of an image can create rollover effects.
- Creating image sprites reduces the number of images browsers need to load.

## Chapter19: _Practical Information_
- Search Engine Optimization (SEO) helps to direct visitors to sites via search engines.  The on-page locations where keywords appear are:
    - Page title
    - URL/Web address
    - Headings
    - Text
    - Link text
    - Image alt text
    - Page descriptions
- The six steps to help identify the best keywords and phrases for a site are:
    - Brainstorm
    - Organize
    - Research
    - Compare
    - Refine
    - Map
- Analytics tools reveal the number of people who have visited your site over a specified period of time (`visits`, `unique visits`, `page views`, `pages per visit`, `average time on site`, `date selector`, and `export`), their browsing path to get there (`referrers`, `direct`, `search terms`, and `advanced features`), and what they did once they arrived (`pages`, `landing pages`, `top exit pages`, and `bounce rate`).
- Obtaining a domain name and various types of web hosting (`disk space`, `bandwidth`, `backups`, `email accounts`, `server-side languages and databases`) are needed in order to put a site online.
- Files can be transfered between local computers and web servers via FTP programs.
- Platforms are provided by a variety of companies in which blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce, and other popular website tools can be created and utilized through templates.

## _Video and Audio APIs_
- HTML5 contains `<video>` and `<audio>` elements for embedding rich media in documents which can be controlled via APIs.
- The `HTMLMediaElement` API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically via `HTMLMediaElement.play()` and `HTMLMediaElement.pause()`, for example. This interface is available to both `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, whose features are nearly identical.

## Chapter9: _Flash, Video, & Audio_
- Flash movies can only be created through the authoring environment within Adobe software.
- Flash files are created with a `.fla` extension and then resaved with a `.swf` extension for use on the web.
- Traditionally, Flash created code using HTML `<object>` and `<embed>` tags when exporting into the `.swf` format which allowed Flash movies to be embedded within web pages, but it's far more common to utilize JavaScript these days.
